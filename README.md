# MySql Learning
For learning, added Brad Traversy's cheat sheet `mysql_cheat_sheet.md` which contains overall basics.

#### server1
used `mysql2` package for managing db.

### server2
used `sequelize` orm for managing db.

### server3
used `sequelize` orm with `sequelize-cli` for managing db.
  * need to install `sequelize-cli` globally to use `sequelize` commands. If you not prefer to use as global, then you can use `npx sequelize-cli {command}`
  * `sequelize init` - It will create the basic setups for the project.

### server4
Is extended version of `server3`. It uses `migrations`.
